So I decided to work on my first ever full react app after i took @developedbyed's creative react course.

Project Overview
This is a Single Page Application weather app that has the following functions 1. Weather report for every location including a 3days forecast. 2. Favorites storage of your locations you add and forecast included 3. Notification alerts for your favorite locations

Technologies

I used the following packages in achieving this goal.

I can't abviously leave out react, react-dom and react-router.

I also used styled-components and framer-motion to style and add some beautiful anniamtions to the project respectively.

I used react-redux or redux to manage my state ans also used some hooks along side

Hope you love it❤️✌️
